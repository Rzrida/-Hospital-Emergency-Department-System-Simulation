Hospital Emergency Department (ED) Simulation for Resource Management

The Emergency Department (ED) is an integral part of 
hospitals. Admissions from the ED account for a 
significant proportion for a hospitalâ€™s activity. Ensuring a 
timely and efficient flow of patients through the ED is 
crucial for optimizing patient care. In recent years, ED 
overcrowding and its impact on patient flow has become a 
major issue facing the health sector. 
Simulation is rapidly becoming a tool of choice 
when examining hospital systems due to its capacity to 
involve numerous factors and interactions that impact the 
system. In this project, a simulation model is developed to 
investigate potential impacts of changing the following 
aspects of ED (number of beds; number and rate of patient 
arrivals; acuity of illness or injury of patients; hospital 
staffing arrangements; and access to inpatient beds). The
project combines implementation of basic data structures 
(priority queues, lists, arrays) with the design and
implementation of several interesting interacting classes. 
In addition, you learn analysis of simulation results to 
evaluate ED performance efficiency. The performance of 
ED can be measured by one or more of the following 
performance indicators: waiting time; bed utilization and 
access block
